# **AcademiaDrive - University Notes Sharing Platform**

Welcome to **AcademiaDrive**, a platform designed to solve the problem of accessing and sharing study materials within your university or college. If your university doesn't provide easy access to study materials, or if you just want to make your own notes available to others, **AcademiaDrive** is the solution.

The platform takes your existing Google Drive-based file-sharing system and upgrades it to a **GitHub Pages**-hosted website, making it more user-friendly and easily accessible for everyone in your college or university.

### **How It Works:**

**AcademiaDrive** allows you to create, upload, and share your notes in a simple, clean way. All you need to do is create a folder structure inside the **public** folder, upload your notes, and the website automatically reflects the changes.
